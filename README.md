MIS: Modular Integrated Systems
@Authors: Kevin Hewitt, Aaron Weinberg, Christina Berardi

Description:
MIS is a variety of software modules placed throughout the home. These modules act as a source of general knowledge displaying information
relevant to its location within the house, and the standard houshold activities that occur in its proximity. 
Each module acts differently. A wardrobe module displays all clothing items in a closet. An entryway module shows who's home and who isn't.
